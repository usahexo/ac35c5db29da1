      		<h1 id="Casino-Executives-Blame-Poor-Blackjack-Strategy-for-Wynn’s-Sluggish-Earnings"><a href="#Casino-Executives-Blame-Poor-Blackjack-Strategy-for-Wynn’s-Sluggish-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Casino Executives Blame Poor Blackjack Strategy for Wynn’s Sluggish Earnings"></a>Casino Executives Blame Poor Blackjack Strategy for Wynn’s Sluggish Earnings</h1><p>Casino operators are feeling the heat as profits from their blackjack tables continue to sag. Wynn Resorts, MGM and Las Vegas Sands all reported earnings below expectations last week, with executives blame lousy player strategy for the shortfall.</p>
<p>“Our customers are just playing too conservatively these days,” said Stephen Wynn, CEO of Wynn Resorts. “They’re not making enough bets and they’re not betting on the right hands. That’s really hurting our bottom line.”</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts reported a net income of $312 million for the second quarter of 2017, down from $418 million during the same period last year. MGM saw a similar drop in earnings, while Las Vegas Sands reported a 5% decrease in profits.</p>
<p>Industry insiders say that casinos are losing an estimated $1 billion annually due to bad blackjack play. In order to claw back some of those losses, casino operators are now considering implementing new strategies to encourage players to be more aggressive at the table.</p>
<p> Strategies such as increasing minimum bets and introducing bonus payouts for big wins could help to juice up profits in the short term. But analysts say that longer-term solutions may be needed if casinos are going to keep pace with online gaming companies like PokerStars and 888 Holdings, which have been eating into the market share of brick-and-mortar establishments in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Casino-Loses-Money-as-Customers-Stick-to-Basic-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#Wynn-Casino-Loses-Money-as-Customers-Stick-to-Basic-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Casino Loses Money as Customers Stick to Basic Blackjack Strategy"></a>Wynn Casino Loses Money as Customers Stick to Basic Blackjack Strategy</h1><p>In a recent turn of events, the Wynn Casino has announced that they have lost “millions of dollars” as players continue to stick to basic blackjack strategy. Basic blackjack strategy is a system that allows players to make the most advantageous decisions in order to increase their chances of winning. The strategy requires players to make a number of mathematical calculations in order to determine when to hit and stand, when to double down and split pairs, and when to take insurance.</p>
<p>Wynn executives are said to be “frustrated” by the turn of events, as they had initially anticipated that players would be less likely to use basic blackjack strategy in a luxurious casino setting. In fact, the opposite appears to be true, as many customers are comfortable using their knowledge of the game to win small amounts of money rather than risk larger sums in order to potentially lose more.</p>
<p>One Wynn executive commented on the situation, saying, “It’s really frustrating. We thought we could lure people in with our luxurious setting and then get them to play recklessly and lose more money, but it hasn’t worked out that way. I guess people are smarter than we thought.”</p>
<p>Whether or not this trend will continue for Wynn Casino is yet to be seen, but for now it seems as though basic blackjack strategy is here to stay.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Casino’s-Losses-Could-Have-Been-Avoided-with-Better-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#Wynn-Casino’s-Losses-Could-Have-Been-Avoided-with-Better-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Casino’s Losses Could Have Been Avoided with Better Blackjack Strategy"></a>Wynn Casino’s Losses Could Have Been Avoided with Better Blackjack Strategy</h1><p>The Wynn casino in Las Vegas has recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This is the second major casino to file for bankruptcy in 2019, after the MGM Grand casino did the same in January.</p>
<p>There are many factors that could have contributed to the casinos’ financial troubles. However, one particular area where the casinos may have fallen short is in their blackjack strategy.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a popular casino game that pits players against the dealer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player can either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn).</p>
<p>The Wynn and MGM casinos both employed a strategy known as “basic strategy.” This approach is statistically proven to be the best way to play blackjack, and it’s used by most professional blackjack players.</p>
<p>However, the casinos’ approach differed in one key way: they would always stand on 17. In contrast, basic strategy recommends hitting on 17 if the dealer is showing a low card (2 through 6).</p>
<p>This small difference may seem insignificant, but it can mean the difference between winning and losing money. In fact, if the casinos had followed basic strategy, they would have avoided losses of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>It’s unclear why the casinos decided to deviate from basic strategy in this way. Perhaps they were trying to increase their chances of winning, or maybe they simply didn’t know about basic strategy’s benefits.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it’s clear that better blackjack strategy could have helped avoid the Wynn and MGM casinos’ financial woes.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Is-Wynn-Casino-Struggling-When-Other-Casinos-Are-Succeeding"><a href="#Why-Is-Wynn-Casino-Struggling-When-Other-Casinos-Are-Succeeding" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Wynn Casino Struggling When Other Casinos Are Succeeding?"></a>Why Is Wynn Casino Struggling When Other Casinos Are Succeeding?</h1><p>Wynn casino is a luxury casino and resort located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The casino opened in April 2005 and features 2,716 guest rooms and suites, 110,000 square feet (10,000 m2) of gaming space, including a 115,000-square-foot (10,700 m2) casino and a 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) night club. Wynn also has a private golf course designed by Tom Fazio. </p>
<p>The resort is named for casino developer Steve Wynn. The $2.7 billion project was the largest privately funded construction project in history at the time. The resort was also the first Las Vegas hotel to be awarded the Mobil five-star rating. </p>
<p>The company has been struggling recently though with different controversies. What makes Wynn different from other casinos?</p>
<p>There are many possible reasons why Wynn casino is struggling when other casinos are succeeding. Probably the most significant difference between Wynn and other casinos is that Wynn is a luxury resort while most other casinos are more focused on gambling and less on amenities. This could be one reason why revenue growth has been slowing at Wynn while it continues to grow at other casinos.</p>
<p>Another reason might be that Wynn has been more adversely affected than others by the decline in tourism to Las Vegas caused by the economic recession and increased competition from new resorts such as those built by Sheldon Adelson’s companies Venetian Resort-Hotel-Casino and Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino. In addition, the legalization of gambling in neighboring states such as California has resulted in some customers defecting to those casinos instead of traveling to Las Vegas. </p>
<p>Wynn’s high prices might also be a factor since customers may be choosing other resorts where they can get more for their dollar. In addition, there have been some allegations of sexual misconduct against Steve Wynn which may have tarnished the brand name. </p>
<p>Whatever the specific reasons for its relative underperformance, it is clear that Wynn needs to make some adjustments if it wants to stay competitive in the coming years</p>
<h1 id="How-Casinos-Can-Turn-a-Profit-Even-When-Customers-Use-Basic-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#How-Casinos-Can-Turn-a-Profit-Even-When-Customers-Use-Basic-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="How Casinos Can Turn a Profit Even When Customers Use Basic Blackjack Strategy"></a>How Casinos Can Turn a Profit Even When Customers Use Basic Blackjack Strategy</h1><p>Casinos make their money by taking a percentage of each bet as profit. In most casino games, the house edge is set in favor of the casino so that over time they will make more money than they pay out. However, this is not the case in blackjack. Thanks to the use of basic blackjack strategy, players can reduce the house edge to less than 1%.</p>
<p>This means that casinos can still turn a profit even when players use basic blackjack strategy. In fact, casinos make a greater profit from blackjack than any other casino game. This article will explore how casinos can make a profit from blackjack even when players use basic strategy.</p>
<p>The first way that casinos make a profit from blackjack is by keeping the house edge high. While basic strategy reduces the house edge to less than 1%, most players do not use it correctly. This allows casinos to make a healthy profit from blackjack even when players are using basic strategy.</p>
<p>In addition, casinos can also make money by offering side bets. These side bets often have much higher house edges than the main game, and so casinos can make a lot of money by offering them. Players who are unaware of these high house edges can quickly lose their money by playing these side bets.</p>
<p>Finally, casinos can also make money by restricting which games players are allowed to play. Blackjack has one of the lowest house edges of all casino games, so casinos often limit its availability in order to increase profits from other games with higher house edges. This means that players who want to play blackjack often have to accept lower odds and pay higher stakes in order to do so.</p>
