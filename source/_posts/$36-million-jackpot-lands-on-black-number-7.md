#  $36 million jackpot lands on black number 7

Players at the Winfall casino in downtown Las Vegas were delighted to see the black number 7 land on the roulette wheel, resulting in a $36 million jackpot. The lucky gambler, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was celebrating late into the night with champagne and caviar.

This is not the first time that the black number 7 has come up lucky at the Winfall casino. In fact, it has happened six times in the past 12 months, resulting in payouts totaling $216 million.

The President of Winfall, James Hall, attributes the casino's success to its unique betting system, which allows players to bet on multiple numbers simultaneously. "Our system is so simple that even a child can understand it," said Hall. "And because there are no complex rules to remember, our players can focus on what really matters - winning."

The black number 7 is not the only lucky number at Winfall. The red number 7 has also paid out big jackpots in the past, including a $24 million payout last year. So if you're looking for some luck of your own, be sure to visit Winfall and place a bet on the roulette wheel!

#  Roulette player scoops $1.7 million payout on red 26

In what can only be considered a lucky break, one roulette player has scooped an incredible $1.7 million payout after placing a bet on red 26. The anonymous player is said to have placed the bet at Atlantic City’s Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, and managed to win on the very first spin of the wheel.

While it is unclear as to exactly how much the player wagered in total, the odds of red 26 coming up are 1 in 30, 835, 206 - making this one of the most sizable payouts ever recorded at the casino. In fact, it’s thought that this particular win may even eclipse Borgata’s previous record payout of $1 million, which was awarded back in 2014.

Speaking about the win, a spokesperson for Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa said: “This is an incredible Roulette payout and we are thrilled for our lucky guest. Our guests come from all over the world and hit jackpots every day but this one really takes the cake!”

Interestingly, $1.7 million is just shy of being enough to buy a luxury home in some areas of the United States. In Los Angeles, for example, you could buy yourself a 4-bed home for around $2 million or a 5-bed for just over $3 million. However, if you’re not quite ready to splash out on property just yet, there are plenty of other things you could do with that kind of cash - like travel the world or purchase a fleet of supercars!

For roulette players out there who are still waiting for their big break, it’s worth noting that red 26 doesn’t come up all that often. In fact, it only comes up around once every 30 spins or so - so you’ll need plenty of luck on your side if you want to walk away with the big prize!

#  Second big roulette win in as many days for Ontario casino goer

For the second time in as many days, an Ontario casino goer has walked away from a roulette table with a big win. Yesterday, a Kitchener woman won over $24,000 on a single spin at Casino Rama. Just one day later, a man from London hit the jackpot for over $51,000 at Caesars Windsor.

Both winners say that they had no idea that they were going to win so much money and were simply playing for fun. "I just couldn't believe it when I won," said the Kitchener woman. "I was so happy."

The wins are a welcome boost to the casinos' bottom lines, which have been struggling in recent years thanks to increased competition from online gambling sites. In response, both Caesars Windsor and Casino Rama have recently introduced new and improved slot machines as well as table games like blackjack and roulette.

The lucky streak at Casino Rama has led to some renewed interest in the property, which is currently up for sale. The winning Kitchener woman said that she is now thinking about buying the casino if it is sold. "It would be amazing to own my own casino," she said. "But I'm not sure if I could handle all of the stress."

#  Woman wins nearly $600,000 on spin of the wheel at Atlantic City casino 

What would you do if you won nearly $600,000 on the spin of a wheel? Well, one woman in Atlantic City was recently able to answer that question. She had been playing at the Borgata Casino for just a few hours when she hit the jackpot.

The woman, who has not been identified, was playing at one of the casino's roulette tables when she placed a $25 bet on black and spun the wheel. To her amazement, the ball landed on black 18 times in a row, resulting in her winning nearly $600,000.

"I couldn't believe it," said the winner in an interview with reporters after she claimed her prize. "I thought I was dreaming."

She added that she plans to use the money to pay off some bills and take a vacation. "This is such a life-changing amount of money," she said. "I'm just so happy."

Casinos often offer players the chance to win large jackpots by betting on black or red, odd or even, or by selecting particular numbers. However, the odds of winning are typically quite low, making it difficult for players to walk away with any significant profits.

In this case, the woman's lucky streak resulted in one of the largest payouts ever at the Borgata Casino. And while it's certainly not something that happens every day, it goes to show that anything can happen when you're playing at a casino table. So if you're feeling lucky, why not give it a try?

#  Bettor scores massive $177,000 payout from single spin at Quebec casino

An Ottawa man is celebrating this week after scoring a massive $177,000 payout from a single spin at a Quebec casino.

The unidentified Bettor, who is in his 60s, said he was feeling lucky on the day he visited the Casino de Charlevoix and decided to play the slot machines. After about an hour of gambling, the Bettor hit the jackpot on a machine called "Gypsy Rose" with a $0.25 wager.

"I just couldn't believe it," he said of his reaction upon seeing the winnings. "I still can't believe it."

Casino officials say it's not uncommon for players to score big payouts from time to time, but they could not recall anyone winning as much money as the Bettor did on a single spin.

"It's definitely an exciting moment when someone hits a big jackpot like that," said spokesperson Martin Brouillard. "We're glad that he was able to enjoy his experience here and hopefully it will be a memorable one."

The Bettor says he plans to use the money to pay off some bills and take a vacation with his family. He added that he will likely return to the casino in the future, but with a bit more restraint this time around.
