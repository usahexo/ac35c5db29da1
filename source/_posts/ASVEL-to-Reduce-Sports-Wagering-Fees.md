#  ASVEL to Reduce Sports Wagering Fees

On Monday, ASVEL, a French basketball club announced that it will cut the fees charged for sports betting starting in the 2020-2021 season. This move is seen as a way to combat illegal gambling and better protect the sport from match-fixing.

The president of ASVEL, David Pasquier, stated that the new rates will be much more affordable for both small and large bettors. He also emphasized that this change is meant to increase transparency in the industry and make it more difficult for anyone intent on fixing matches to do so unnoticed.

Illegal gambling has been a longstanding issue in France and across Europe. In response, many countries have cracked down on the practice by increasing regulatory scrutiny and making it more difficult to place bets. This has had varying levels of success, with some areas seeing a decline in illegal gambling while others continue to face significant challenges.

France has been at the forefront of the effort to combat match-fixing in sports. In 2016, the country passed a law that made it a criminal offense to fix any sporting event. The law also increased sanctions for those caught partaking in illegal gambling activities.

ASVEL’s decision to reduce its betting fees is just one step in France’s broader efforts to address this problem. Other initiatives include improved cooperation between police and sporting organizations as well as public awareness campaigns.

#  ASVEL Cuts Sports Betting Fees by Nearly Half

ASVEL, the leading sports betting provider in Europe, has announced a new fee structure that will see fees reduced by nearly half.

Starting May 1st, 2019, the company will charge a 4 percent fee on all winning bets instead of the current 8 percent. This represents a significant saving for bettors, who will now keep more of their winnings.

 ASVEL CEO Cyril Collot believes the new fee structure will make the company more competitive and attract more customers.

“This new fee structure is aimed at making our product more attractive and helping us to grow market share. We believe it will be well received by our customers and look forward to welcoming even more people to our platform.”

The news was welcomed by bettors, with many taking to social media to express their gratitude.

“Big thanks to ASVEL for slashing betting fees! I was about to give up on them but this change has made me stay loyal!” tweeted one happy customer.

#  ASVEL Slashes Sports Betting Fees Again

Founded in 2004, ASVEL is a French professional basketball club based in Lyon. The team competes in the LNB Pro A, the top-tier level of French professional basketball.

For the third time this year, ASVEL has announced it is slashing sports betting fees for its customers. In a statement on its website, the club said that it is committed to providing "the best possible betting experience for our fans."

The new fee schedule went into effect on October 1 and reduces the cost of most bets by between 5% and 10%. ASVEL said that the move was made in response to customer feedback and that it plans to continue lowering fees throughout the season.

"We're always looking for ways to improve our product and make betting easier and more affordable for our fans," said ASVEL spokesperson Jean-Philippe Gomez. "Our goal is to give them the best possible experience whether they're betting on football, basketball or any other sport."

The announcement from ASVEL comes at a time when competition in the global sports betting market is heating up. In July, British bookmaker William Hill agreed to be acquired by Canadian gaming company Eldorado Resorts in a deal worth $2.7 billion. The move is expected to create one of the world's largest gambling companies, with a combined revenue of more than $4 billion.

The Eldorado / William Hill deal is just the latest in a series of acquisitions and mergers that have reshaped the global gambling industry over the past few years. In 2017, French online gaming company Groupe Partouche acquired Belgian casino operator Circus Casino Holdings for €220 million. The next year, GVC Holdings purchased Ladbrokes Coral Group for £3.9 billion, creating one of Europe's largest gambling companies.

With so much money at stake, it's no surprise that traditional sports teams are getting into the sports betting business. In August, American football team Miami Dolphins partnered with London-based sports betting company SportPesa to launch an online sportsbook in Florida. The move gives SportPesa a foothold in one of America's most lucrative gambling markets.

ASVEL's decision to reduce betting fees again is likely to give it an edge over its competitors in France and abroad. By making betting more affordable, ASVEL gives its fans a reason to stick with its site when there are so many other options available.

#  ASVEL Continues to Lower Sports Wagering Fees

The French basketball club ASVEL Lyon-Villeurbanne announced on Thursday that it will lower its sports wagering fees to 5 percent starting with the next season. The move comes after the club’s main rival, Olympique Lyonnais, lowered its fees to 3 percent in December.

ASVEL has been among the most aggressive clubs in France when it comes to lowering sports wagering fees. In October, the club lowered its fees to 10 percent from 15 percent. That move put ASVEL in line with the other top clubs in France, including Strasbourg and Monaco.

Reducing the fees is a way for ASVEL to stay competitive and attract more punters. The club is coming off a disappointing season in which it failed to make it past the first round of the playoffs.

Olympique Lyonnais, on the other hand, had a much better season and reached the semifinals of the European Champions League. But Lyon’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas, said he was forced to lower fees because other clubs were doing so and that it was important for French basketball as a whole that Lyon remain competitive.

ASVEL’s decision is good news for bettors because it means they will now have to pay less to wager on games involving French teams. It’s also good news for the French basketball league because it could lead to more competition and increased interest from bettors.

#  ASVEL Announce Another Reduction in Sports Betting Fees

ASVEL, the leading French sports betting operator, today announced a new reduction in its fees.

The new fee structure will be effective as of 1st January 2019 and will see the company reduce its fees for all bets placed on sports matches. The reductions will apply to both pre-match and live betting, with the company’s fees falling from 5% to 4% for pre-match bets, and from 10% to 8% for live bets.

In a statement released this morning, Laurent Mignon, CEO of ASVEL, said: “We are always looking for ways to improve our service and provide our customers with the best possible experience. We hope that by reducing our fees we can encourage even more people to bet on sports matches, and that this will lead to even more successful outcomes for our customers.”

The news was welcomed by bettors throughout France, who have long been calling for reductions in sports betting fees. Eugene Kressinov, a 56-year-old accountant from Paris, said: “This is great news! I’ve been waiting years for operators like ASVEL to reduce their fees – it really helps to keep the cost of gambling down. I’ll definitely be taking advantage of these new rates.”

ASVEL is not the only operator to announce reduced fees in recent months. In November last year William Hill launched a new fee structure which saw the company reduce its fees from 5% to 2%. This was followed by Betfair lowering its fees from 5% to 3% in December.
