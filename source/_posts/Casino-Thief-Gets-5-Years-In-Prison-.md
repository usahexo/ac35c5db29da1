#  Casino Thief Gets 5 Years In Prison 

In a Las Vegas court on Tuesday, career criminal Mark Anthony Grant was sentenced to five years in prison for stealing $2,000 from the casino where he worked. 

The thefts occurred over a period of two months in late 2016, with Grant targeting the safe at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa where he was employed as a croupier. 

Prosecutors were seeking a seven-year sentence for Grant, but judges settled on five after hearing from his lawyer that the former Marine suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. 

Grant's lawyer also noted that his client has already served time in prison for other crimes, and is a "model inmate" who has participated in many rehabilitation programs while behind bars. 

Prior to Tuesday's sentencing, Grant had expressed remorse for his actions and said he wanted to seek treatment for his mental health issues.
