#  3 burial containers for the price of 1 slot machine! 

The popularity of slot machines has exploded in the past decade. In fact, according to the American Gaming Association, in 2017 there were 1,011 operational slot machines in Nevada casinos and thatâ€™s just one state!

While this gambling phenomenon is exciting and entertaining for many people, some are looking for alternative ways to spend their time and money. If you are one of these people, you may be wondering if there are any other types of casino games out there.

There sure are! Below we will explore three unique burial containers you can find in a casino: settle your bets on a roulette wheel, pick your poker hand with blackjack, or try your luck with a giant slot machine!

## Roulette 
Roulette is a classic casino game that can be found in almost any gambling house around the world. The objective of the game is simple â€“ to predict where the spinning ball will land on the wheel. There are 36 slots on the wheel (including 0 and 00), each with a different point value assigned to it. Players place their bets by placing chips on the layout board that corresponds with their prediction. After all bets have been placed, the dealer spins the ball in one direction around the wheel, then spins the wheel in the opposite direction. The ball eventually falls into one of the slots and players who placed bets on that number win multiplied by their bet amount. For example, if you bet $10 on red and red comes up, you would win $190 ($10 Bet x 19).

## Blackjack 
Blackjack is another popular casino game that can be found in most gambling houses. The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealerâ€™s hand without going over 21 points. Cards 2-10 are worth face value, Aces are worth 1 or 11 points (playerâ€™s choice), and face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10 points each. If a player has more than 21 points at any time during the game, they bust and lose automatically. The dealer must hit until they have at least 17 points; if they bust (go over 21), all players still alive in the hand win automatically. Like roulette, players place their bets by placing chips on the layout board that corresponds with their prediction. After all bets have been placed, play begins with both player and dealer drawing two cards each. The playerâ€™s first card is face up while the dealerâ€™s first card is face down (the hole card). Based on these two cards, players can choose to take additional cards (hit) or stand pat (stick). Play then continues until both player and dealer have either busted or reached 21 points; whichever occurs first determines whether player or dealer wins automatically.

## Slot Machine 
Slot machines arguably offer some of the best odds in a casino when compared to other games like roulette and blackjack; however, they also come with some of the worst odds when it comes to payouts! Regardless of this factoid though, slot machines continue to be one of â€“ if not THE â€“ most popular type of game found at casinos across North America and beyond due mainly to our love affair with big payouts and flashy lights ðŸ™‚ Slot machines come in all shapes and sizes but typically have 3-5 spinning reels with symbols landing on each reel determining whether or not a payout occurs. To play a slot machine game, players insert coins into the machine or use credits earned from playing other casino games â€“ once enough credits are accumulated , players can activate spin/play mode by pressing a button or pulling a lever depending on which machine you are playing on! Like roulette and blackjack, players place their bets by placing chips on certain areas of the machine corresponding with their bet amount(s). After all bets are placed, gameplay begins automatically when spin/play mode has been activated; as mentioned earlier Payouts vary depending on what symbols line up but usually fall between 1x-2000x your initial bet amount(s)!
